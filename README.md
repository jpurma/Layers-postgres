# Layers-postgres
Here is Dockerfile for having postgres (9.3) on top of learninglayers/base -environment. 

It should go to docker.hub as learninglayers/postgres

It is almost completely copied from scripts in https://github.com/docker-library/postgres 
Instead of building on this, you probably want to go there.
